# Rental Car Privacy Risk Assessment: A GRC Perspective

This project explores the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with syncing mobile devices to rental car infotainment systems. It provides a full GRC analysis including risk identification, framework mapping, policy development, and user awareness training.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Identify real-world risks when users sync phones to rental cars.
- Map those risks to industry frameworks like NIST CSF, GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, and ISO/SAE 21434.
- Create deliverables that a GRC professional would use: risk register, policy templates, user checklists, and training materials.
